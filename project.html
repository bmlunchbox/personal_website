					<div class="project-title">StayTrack</div>
					<div class="sub-heading">Context</div>
					<div class="project-paragraph">Patient care typically spans multiple departments, hospital floors, and sometimes days. Hospitals can be hectic and resultingly key pieces of information can be lost in transition. The standard methodology for tracking this information is using departmental, colour-coded whiteboards and spreadsheets. <a class="highlight" href="#StayTrack">StayTrack</a> was designed to consolidate them using a real-time, collaborative, and intuitive solution.</div>

					<div class="sub-heading">Development</div>
					<div class="project-paragraph">At <a class="highlight" href="career.html#Oculys">Oculys</a>, I spent the majority of my time building microservices for the <a class="highlight" href="#StayTrack">StayTrack</a> platform. I worked with product managers to design storyboards and UIs that catered to the level of detail needed. This included preserving the original colours and formatting, while streamlining and standardizing the processes. I built modules to input and modify triage acuity scores, patient diagnoses, plans of care, various considerations, and therapy scheduling. This was built using <a class="highlight" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" target="_blank">C#</a>, <a class="highlight" href="https://www.asp.net/" target="_blank">ASP.NET</a>, <a class="highlight" href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>, and <a class="highlight" href="https://www.asp.net/signalr" target="_blank">SignalR</a> applying an MVC architectural pattern.</div>

					<div class="project-paragraph">Trivia is fun! <a class="highlight" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intermedia.hq&hl=en_CA" target="_blank">HQ Trivia</a> is a live mobile game where players are given 10 seconds per question and must answer all 12 correctly to win. I built a bot to determine the most probable answer.</div> 

					<div class="sub-heading">Development</div>
					<div class="project-paragraph">I used optical character recognition to extract the text and classified them using pattern matching. From there, I fed them through <a class="highlight" href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/" target="_blank">Google Analytics’</a> natural language processor to retrieve pronouns and assign salience scores. From there I produced multiple search queries ranging from just the question’s key words to combinations of the question and each query. Different scores are given to each results; some given for sheer quantity and others for answer matches. I’m in the process of implementing a gradient boost model so that the scores are dynamically assigned to queries based on question classification.</div>

					<div class="sub-heading">Context</div>
					<div class="project-paragraph">At <a class="highlight" href="career.html#WalterFedy">WalterFedy</a>, there were two television monitors in the common area that played CP24 all day. Operations proposed a solution that would put them to better use while satisfying the business need for readily available and visually appealing KPIs. The spin-off benefits of this solution would be that it increased project transparency between departments and with upper management.</div>

					<div class="project-paragraph">The dashboard has a fixed framework and holds modular components on a rotational basis. Beyond the requested KPIs, the solution expanded to cover fun tidbits of company information, environmental impact assessments, Sunday comic strips, and local news. Local news drew from sanitized <a class="highlight" href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> RSS feeds, while the rest of the information came from a <a class="highlight" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/sql-server/sql-server-2017" target="_blank">SQL</a> database. The dashboard was primarily built using <a class="highlight" href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> using <a class="highlight" href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> as its framework and <a class="highlight" href="https://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3.js</a> for the data visuals.</div>

					<div class="sub-heading">Context</div>
					<div class="project-paragraph">Keeping track of company technology, furniture, and machinery was done separately and inconsistently by different departments. A solution would be needed to centralize existing data sets, provide a means to add new ones, and generate department-specific reports for accounting and IT. </div>

					<div class="sub-heading">Development</div>
					<div class="project-paragraph">After numerous iterations of research and proposal, building a solution around QR codes seemed like the cheapest option while still satisfying base requirements. The codes were generated using <a class="highlight" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/" target="_blank">Google’s API</a> and attached to each asset. I built a QR decoder using <a class="highlight" href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> in <a class="highlight" href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, which was then wrapped with <a class="highlight" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/" target="_blank">C#</a> in order for it to integrate with the rest of the solution. To democratize the data stored in <a class="highlight" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/sql-server/sql-server-2017" target="_blank">SQL</a>, I created portals with a two-way sync between Excel and SQL that would allow users to access and edit data from either end. </div>
